# Module 1: Introduction to Python

## ðŸ”¹ Theory

### 1.1 History of Python

Developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s; released in 1991.
Inspired by languages like ABC, C, and Modula-3.
Open-source and easy to read, making it beginner-friendly.
Widely used in web development, data science, automation, AI, etc.

### 1.2 Features of Python

Easy to learn and use
Interpreted and dynamically typed
High-level language
Supports multiple paradigms (OOP, procedural, functional)
Large standard library
Portable and extensible

### 1.3 Setting Up Python

Install from python.org
Use IDLE, VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, or online IDEs like Replit or Google Colab

### 1.4 Running Python Code

Interactive Mode: Type directly in terminal or IDLE
Script Mode: Save code in .py file and run via terminal or IDE

### 1.5 Basic Syntax

Indentation is mandatory (uses whitespace)

Comments:

Single-line: # comment

Multi-line: triple quotes (`''' ... '''` or `""" ... """`)

### 1.6 Variables and Data Types

- Variables: dynamic, no need to declare types

```python
name = "Anurag" # String
age = 20 # integer
pi = 3.14 # Float
is_student = True # Boolean
```

- Data Types:
    1. Numeric: int, float, complex
    2. Sequence: str, list, tuple
    3. Set: set
    4. Mapping: dict
    5. Boolean: bool

### 1.7 Operators

- Arithmetic: `+ - * / // % **`

- Comparison: `== != > < >= <=`

- Logical: `and or not`

- Assignment: `= += -= *= ...`

- Bitwise: `& | ^ ~ << >>`

- Membership: `in, not in`

- Identity: `is, is not`
